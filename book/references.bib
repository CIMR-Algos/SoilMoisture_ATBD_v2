abstract = {Vegetation optical depth (VOD) is a remotely sensed indicator characterizing the attenuation of the Earth's thermal emission at microwave wavelengths by the vegetation layer. At L-band, VOD is used to estimate the global biomass, a key component of the Earth's surface and of the carbon cycle. This study focuses on the behaviour of L-band VOD (L-VOD) retrieval algorithm over seasonally inundated areas, as some previous observations have shown an unexpected decline in VOD during flooding events. To analyse such variations, a passive microwave model was used to simulate the signal emitted by a mixed scene composed of soil and standing water. The retrieval over this inundated scene led to an overestimation of soil moisture (SM) and an underestimation of L-VOD. The phenomenon is more pronounced over grasslands than over forests, since low vegetation is mostly submerged under water and becomes invisible to the sensor; and since more standing water is visible to the sensor. The estimated L-VOD is typically reduced by {\~{}}10{\%} over flooded forests and up to 100{\%} over flooded grasslands. Such effects can distort the analysis of aboveground biomass (AGB) and aboveground carbon (AGC) dynamics based on L-VOD estimates. We evaluated that AGB can be underestimated by 15/20 Mg ha−1 in the largest seasonal wetlands, which can represent more than 50{\%} of the actual AGB of these fields, and up to higher values during exceptional meteorological years. Consequently, to better estimate the global biomass, surface water seasonality has to be taken into account in passive microwave retrieval algorithms.},

Recently, the CETB team processed the first 4 years of enhanced resolution Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L-band (1.41 GHz) radiometer T{\textless}sub{\textgreater}B{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} images. The CETB processing employs the radiometer form of the Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (rSIR) algorithm to create enhanced resolution images, which are posted on fine resolution grids. In this paper, we evaluate the effective resolution of the SMAP T{\textless}sub{\textgreater}B{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} image products using coastline and island crossings. We similarly evaluate the effective resolution of the SMAP L1C{\_}TB{\_}E enhanced resolution product that is based on Backus-Gilbert processing. We present a comparison of the spatial resolution of the rSIR and L1C{\_}TB{\_}E enhanced resolution products with conventionally-processed (gridded) SMAP data. We find that the effective resolution of daily CETB rSIR SMAP T{\textless}sub{\textgreater}B{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} images is slightly finer than that of L1C{\_}TB{\_}E and about 30{\%} finer than conventionally processed data.},

@article{ye2015,
abstract = {Passive microwave remote sensing at L-band has been widely acknowledged as the most promising technique to observe the spatial distribution of near surface (top {\~{}}5cm) soil moisture at regional to global scales. The launch of the ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission in 2009 now means that global space-borne brightness temperature observations are available at L-band (1.41GHz) to estimate soil moisture every 2 to 3days with a target accuracy of 0.04m3/m3. Moreover, NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite has been launched on 31st January 2015, also carrying an L-band radiometer, together with an L-band radar for downscaling the brightness temperature observations to better than 10km resolution. At the SMOS/SMAP radiometer scale of {\~{}}40km, the presence of water bodies potentially induces an overestimation of retrieved soil moisture, if not carefully accounted for in retrieval models. Such water fraction effects on brightness temperature and soil moisture retrieval accuracy were investigated in this study, using airborne L-band brightness temperature data collected during three Australian field experiments. The water induced brightness temperature effect and water fraction were compared under different resolutions, sampling days, and land surface conditions, showing that the water fraction impact on retrieved soil moisture is independent of scale, but heavily dependent on the soil water content status. Subsequently, the highest water fraction threshold that can be tolerated in order to achieve the 0.04m3/m3 target accuracy without correction has been determined as 0.08 (actual range is from 0.02 for dry bare soil to 0.08 for wet vegetated soil). Using a MODIS derived water fraction dataset, the water fraction dynamics were also studied over Australia during the ten years from 2001 to 2010. The results show that if the mean water fraction map was used as a static water map to flag or correct water effects, the water body induced soil moisture retrieval error would have exceeded the 0.04m3/m3 target more than once for 13.5{\%} of the Australian land 40km sized radiometer pixels; only 0.6{\%} Australian land pixels would have exceeded this target with a frequency of 10 times or more per year.},

@article{KONINGS2016,
abstract = {Passive microwave measurements have the potential to estimate vegetation optical depth (VOD), an indicator of aboveground vegetation water content. They are also sensitive to the vegetation scattering albedo and soil moisture. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm to retrieve VOD and soil moisture from time series of dual-polarized L-band radiometric observations along with time-invariant scattering albedo. The method takes advantage of the relatively slow temporal dynamics of early morning vegetation water content and combines a number of consecutive observations to estimate a single VOD. It is termed the multi-temporal dual channel algorithm (MT-DCA). The soil dielectric constant (directly related to soil moisture) of each observation is also retrieved simultaneously. Additionally, the method retrieves a constant albedo, thereby providing for the first time information on global single-scattering albedo variations. The algorithm is tested using three years of L-band passive observations from the NASA Aquarius sensor. The global VOD distribution follows expected gradients of climate and canopy biomass conditions. Its seasonal dynamics follow expected behavior based on precipitation and land cover. The retrieved VOD is closely related to coincident cross-polarized backscatter coefficients. The VOD and dielectric retrievals from MT-DCA are compared to those obtained from implementing the commonly used Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) algorithm and shown to have less high-frequency noise. There is almost as much variation in MT-DCA retrieved albedo between pixels of a given land cover class than between land cover classes, suggesting the common approach of assigning albedo based on land cover class may not capture its spatial variability. Globally, albedo appears to be primarily sensitive to woody biomass. The proposed algorithm allows for a more accurate accounting of the effects of vegetation on radiometric soil moisture retrievals, and generates new observations of L-band VOD and effective single-scattering albedo. These new datasets are complementary to existing remotely sensed vegetation measurements such as fluorescence and optical-infrared indices.},
